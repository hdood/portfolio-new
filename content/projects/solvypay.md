## My Role

I led the end-to-end development of the entire platform, including the multi-tenant merchant admin panel, the mobile application integrated with the payment-device SDK, and the deployment/monitoring infrastructure. I also built and maintained a custom fork of F-Droid to serve as the company’s internal app store.
